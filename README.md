# Django Chat App using Websockets
</div>

## Cloning and starting project
1. - git clone https://github.com/Firuz43/chatbox.git
2. - cd chatbox
3. - pip install -r requirements.txt
4. - python manage.py runserver

I used MongoDB as backend and it has login and registration functionality. When you wirte write a message it will send message to all users. I didn't
write functionality to save messages to database due to time restriction. I was trying to do it in 3 days, some things i was coding and learning along.
You can install packages inside requirements.txt and run application. I will be still working on this app finish some tasks.
